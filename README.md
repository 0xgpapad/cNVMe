# cNVMe
An NVMe Device Simulation Library.

This is a WIP simulation of the protocol-layer of an NVMe Memory Device. The goal is to be able to send NVMe commands down and get full protocol responses. The simulation includes a register level with basic PCIe Controller Registers and simplified Doorbell Registers. It is really cool!
